"""Baby Names exercise

Implement the babyname parser class that parses the popular names and their ranks from an html file.

1) At first, you need to implement a decorator that checks whether the html file exists or not.
2) Also, the parser should extract the tuples of (rank, male-name, female-name) from the file by using regex. 
   For writing regex, it's nice to include a copy of the target text for inspiration.
3) Finally, you need to implement the parse(self, parsing_lambda) method that parses the extracted tuples
   with the given lambda and return the list of processed results.

Here's what the html looks like in the baby.html files:
    ...
    <h3 align="center">Popularity in 1990</h3>
    ....
    <tr align="right"><td>1</td><td>Michael</td><td>Jessica</td>
    <tr align="right"><td>2</td><td>Christopher</td><td>Ashley</td>
    <tr align="right"><td>3</td><td>Matthew</td><td>Brittany</td>
    ...
